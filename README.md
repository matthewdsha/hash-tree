# hash-tree
In collaboration with a classmate, this project uses threads to hash an input file. It uses Jenkens hashing to complete the hashing.

The input file is divided into blocks, and a certain number of blocks is hashed by a threads. This number depends on the number of threads the user choses to use.

Can be ran using ./htree {input file} {number of threads}
